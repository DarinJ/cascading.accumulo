The following are sample programs to demonstrate how to use Cascading[2.5.1] extensions for Accumulo[1.5.0].  The cascading.accumulo project is a work in progress.

Sample program 1:
===================
Covers the following table operations-
Create table
Create table with splits
Check if table exists
Delete table

Sample program 2:
===================
Reads data in Accumulo

Sample program 3:
===================
Transposes data in a flat format in HDFS to an Accumulo-ish layout and writes to HDFS

Sample program 4:
===================
Reads (pre-formatted) data in HDFS and writes it to Accumulo

Sample program 5:
===================
Reads data in Accumulo and write it back to Accumulo

Sample program 6:
===================
Reads data in Accumulo and writes it to HDFS 

Sample program 7:
===================
Reads data in a flat layout in HDFS, transposes/transforms it and saves to Accumulo

Sample program 8:
===================
WIP
Demonstrates how to regex query data in Accumulo

Sample program 9:
===================
WIP
Demonstrates how to count records in Accumulo
